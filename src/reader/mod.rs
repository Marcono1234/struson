//! Module for reading JSON data
//!
//! [`JsonReader`] is the general trait for JSON readers, [`JsonStreamReader`] is an implementation
//! of it which reads a JSON document from a [`Read`] in a streaming way.

/// Module for 'JSON path'
///
/// A 'JSON path' points to a single value in a JSON document. It consists of zero or more [`JsonPathPiece`]
/// elements which either represent the index of a JSON array item or the name of a JSON object member.
/// These pieces combined form the _path_ to a value in a JSON document.
///
/// This is not an implementation of the [JSONPath RFC 9535](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535) standard;
/// the implementation here uses a different syntax and only covers a subset of these features needed for
/// JSON reader functionality, most notably for reporting the location of errors and for [`JsonReader::seek_to`].
/// If you need more functionality, prefer a library which fully implements the JSONPath standard.
///
/// The macro [`json_path!`](json_path::json_path) can be used to create a JSON path in a concise way.
///
/// Consider for example the following code:
/// ```
/// # use struson::reader::json_path::*;
/// vec![
///     JsonPathPiece::ObjectMember("a".to_owned()),
///     JsonPathPiece::ArrayItem(2),
/// ]
/// # ;
/// ```
/// It means: Within a JSON object the member with name "a", and assuming the value of that member is
/// a JSON array, of that array the item at index 2 (starting at 0). The string representation of the
/// path in dot-notation would be `a[2]`.\
/// For example in the JSON string `{"a": [0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}` it would point to the value `2.5`.

///
/// The methods of this reader can be divided into the following categories:
///
/// - Peeking values, without consuming them
///     - [`peek`](Self::peek): Peeks at the type of the next value
///     - [`has_next`](Self::has_next): Checks if there is a next value
/// - Reading values
///     - [`begin_array`](Self::begin_array), [`end_array`](Self::end_array): Starting and ending a JSON array
///     - [`begin_object`](Self::begin_object), [`end_object`](Self::end_object): Starting and ending a JSON object
///     - [`next_name`](Self::next_name), [`next_name_owned`](Self::next_name_owned): Reading the name of a JSON object member
///     - [`next_str`](Self::next_str), [`next_string`](Self::next_string), [`next_string_reader`](Self::next_string_reader): Reading a JSON string value
///     - [`next_number`](Self::next_number), [`next_number_as_str`](Self::next_number_as_str), [`next_number_as_string`](Self::next_number_as_string): Reading a JSON number value
///     - [`next_bool`](Self::next_bool): Reading a JSON boolean value
///     - [`next_null`](Self::next_null): Reading a JSON null value
///     - [`deserialize_next`](Self::deserialize_next): Deserializes a Serde [`Deserialize`](serde::de::Deserialize) from the next value (optional feature)
///  - Skipping values
///     - [`skip_name`](Self::skip_name): Skipping the name of a JSON object member
///     - [`skip_value`](Self::skip_value): Skipping a value
///     - [`seek_to`](Self::seek_to): Skipping values until a specified location is reached
///     - [`seek_back`](Self::seek_back): Skipping to the original nesting level where `seek_to` started
///     - [`skip_to_top_level`](Self::skip_to_top_level): Skipping the remaining elements of all enclosing JSON arrays and objects
///  - Other:
///     - [`transfer_to`](Self::transfer_to): Reading a JSON value and writing it to a given JSON writer
///     - [`consume_trailing_whitespace`](Self::consume_trailing_whitespace): Consuming trailing whitespace at the end of the JSON document
///
/// JSON documents have at least one top-level value which can be either a JSON array, object,
/// string, number, boolean or null value. For JSON arrays and objects the opening brackets
/// must be consumed with the corresponding `begin_` method (for example [`begin_array`](Self::begin_array)) and the
/// closing bracket with the corresponding `end_` method (for example [`end_array`](Self::end_array)). JSON objects
/// consist of *members* which are name-value pairs. The name of a member can be read with
/// [`next_name`](Self::next_name) and the value with any of the value reading methods such as [`next_bool`](Self::next_bool).
///
/// It is not necessary to consume the complete JSON document, for example a user of this reader
/// can simply drop the reader once the relevant information was extracted, ignoring the remainder
/// of the JSON data. However, in that case no validation will be performed that the remainder
/// has actually valid JSON syntax. To ensure that, [`skip_to_top_level`](Self::skip_to_top_level)
/// can be used to skip (and validate) the remainder of the current top-level JSON array or object.
///
/// **Important:** Even after the top-level has been fully consumed this reader does *not*
/// automatically consume the remainder of the JSON document (which is expected to consist
/// of optional whitespace only). To verify that there is no trailing data it is necessary
/// to explicitly call [`consume_trailing_whitespace`](Self::consume_trailing_whitespace).
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use struson::reader::*;
/// // In this example JSON data comes from a string;
/// // normally it would come from a file or a network connection
/// let json = r#"{"a": [1, 2, true]}"#;
/// let mut json_reader = JsonStreamReader::new(json.as_bytes());
///
/// json_reader.begin_object()?;
/// assert_eq!(json_reader.next_name()?, "a");
///
/// json_reader.begin_array()?;
/// assert_eq!(json_reader.next_number::<u32>()??, 1);
/// json_reader.skip_value()?;
/// assert_eq!(json_reader.next_bool()?, true);
/// json_reader.end_array()?;
///
/// json_reader.end_object()?;
/// // Ensures that there is no trailing data
/// json_reader.consume_trailing_whitespace()?;
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Error handling
/// The methods of this reader return a [`Result::Err`] when an error occurs while reading
/// the JSON document. The error can for example be caused by an IO error from the underlying
/// reader, a JSON syntax error or an unexpected structure of the JSON document.
/// See [`ReaderError`] for more details.
///
/// When encountering [`ReaderError::SyntaxError`] and [`ReaderError::IoError`] processing the
/// JSON document **must** be aborted. Trying to call any reader methods afterwards can lead
/// to unspecified behavior, such as errors, panics or incorrect data. However, no _undefined_
/// behavior occurs.
///
/// When encountering [`ReaderError::UnexpectedValueType`] or [`ReaderError::UnexpectedStructure`]
/// depending on the use case it might be possible to continue processing the JSON document
/// (except for [`seek_to`](Self::seek_to) where it might not be obvious how many elements have already been
/// skipped). However, these errors can usually be avoided by using either [`peek`](Self::peek) or [`has_next`](Self::has_next)
/// before trying to consume a value whose type is not known in advance, or for which it
/// is not known whether it is present in the JSON document.
///
/// In general it is recommended to handle errors with the `?` operator of Rust, for example
/// `json_reader.next_bool()?` and to abort processing the JSON document when an error occurs.
///
/// # Panics
/// Methods of this reader panic when used in an incorrect way. The documentation of the methods
/// describes in detail the situations when that will happen. In general all these cases are
/// related to incorrect usage by the user (such as trying to call [`end_object`](Self::end_object) when currently
/// reading a JSON array) and are unrelated to the JSON data which is processed.

    /// same path which had been passed to `seek_to` before, it goes through the path in
    /// reverse order skipping remaining JSON array items and object members and closing
    /// arrays and objects. Therefore once this method returns the reader is at the same
    /// nesting level it was before `seek_to` had been called and allows continuing reading
    /// values there.\
    /// Note that this method only seeks 'back' to the original nesting level, it still
    /// advances _forward_ in the JSON data. So after `seek_to` followed by `seek_back`
    /// had been called, the reader effectively advanced one JSON value (and its nested
    /// values, if any) at the original nesting level.
    ///
    /// For directly getting to the top-level regardless of the current position of the
    /// JSON reader, prefer [`skip_to_top_level`](Self::skip_to_top_level) instead.

    /// The correct usage looks like this:
    /// 1. Call `seek_to` with _path_
    /// 2. Read one or more values
    /// 3. Call `seek_back` with the same _path_
    ///
    /// Using this method in a different way can lead to errors and panics. In particular
    /// it is important that for step 2:
    /// - the value and all nested values (if any) are fully consumed; any additional JSON
    ///   arrays and objects which are started must be closed again
    /// - no enclosing JSON arrays or objects must be closed

    /// stays at its current position and does not consume any JSON tokens.
